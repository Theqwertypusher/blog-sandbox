This is an **informal introduction** to my new blogging format that I like to call the late night keystrokes where my mind wonders, my fingers meanders, and my computer tries to keep up. Similar to how I had my previous blog "Nomad Ala Carte", late night keystrokes will serve as the means to unpack my experiences, delve into my feels, and explore tech casually. Now that I have moved on from my wanderlust kick and have started working in the tech indsturry, I figure creating and hosting my own blog would be a neat endeavor to process the world, distill it with my perspective, and then share it with the world. I don't really have expectations for this to go anywhere as it's more an exercise for me than anything but if it can help and/or entertain someone else - well that's just some extra butter on the bread.
